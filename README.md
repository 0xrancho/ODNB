# ODNB â€“ Old Data, New Business

**ODNB** is a generative customer success and go-to-market strategy engine built for SMB and DTC businesses. It transforms existing customer data into tactical playbooks, segmented audiences, and campaign-ready outreach â€” no data science team required.

Originally designed to support private equity-owned service businesses and sales teams lacking structured CS tools, it now powers multiple front ends â€” including **Big Loud Shirt** â€” to serve verticalized demo use cases.
