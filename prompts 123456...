# Prompt Stack Definitions

This folder contains all modular, reusable GPT prompt logic used to generate insights, segments, and campaigns.

Prompts here are organized around:
- **Goals** → Winback, Expand, Advocate
- **Tactics** → Specific plays (e.g., Reactivation, Premium Upsell)
- **Industry context** → Optional modifiers for language or tone

## Suggested File Format

Use Markdown or YAML for each prompt module:
- `winback_reactivation_prompt.md`
- `expand_bundle_upsell_prompt.md`
- `advocate_review_request_prompt.md`

Each file should contain:
1. 🧠 **System prompt / assistant instructions**
2. 🧾 **Input expectations** (meta fields, inferred insights)
3. 🎯 **Generation steps** (segment rules, buyer intent scoring)
4. ✍️ **Sample response format**
5. 🛑 **Constraints or fallback logic**
