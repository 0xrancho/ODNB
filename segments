# Segments Logic

This folder contains logic for generating customer segments based on industry, goal, and tactic.

Unlike traditional ML models, ODNB and Big Loud Shirt use **declarative, rule-based slicing** via GPT prompt stacks. These heuristics are based on:
- Metadata in uploaded customer files (e.g., Service Date, CSAT, Plan Type)
- Goal â†’ Tactic combinations
- Inferred or uploaded business context

Each file here defines:
- Required metadata
- Segment slicing logic
- Intent scoring rules (if applicable)
- Segment naming or personas

## File Format Suggestions

- `winback_reactivation.md`
- `expand_premium_upgrade.md`
