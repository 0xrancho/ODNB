# Heuristic Scoring Logic

This folder defines simple, rule-based scoring models for segment attributes such as:

- **Buyer Intent**
- **Churn Risk**
- **Engagement Recency**
- **Upsell Readiness**

These scores are inferred from CSV metadata and passed into prompt stacks as variables or filters. This avoids true ML models while preserving the appearance and function of predictive targeting.

## Example: Buyer Intent Score

**Scale:** 0–10  
**Tiers:** Low (0–3), Mid (4–6), High (7–10)

**Possible scoring inputs:**
- Days since last purchase or service
- Plan tier or subscription type
- Recent CSAT scores
- Lifetime Value
- Loyalty / referral history
- Response to past campaigns (if available)

## Usage

Each file in this folder defines:
- Input metadata required
- Scoring rules and weightings
- Output variable name(s)
- Segment tier thresholds

Examples:
- `buyer_intent_score.yaml`
- `churn_risk_score.md`
- `engagement_score.md`
