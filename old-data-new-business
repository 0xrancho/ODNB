# ODNB App (SMB Services Version)

This folder contains the front end logic and demo configuration for the original ODNB interface â€” built to serve SMB service businesses like HVAC, plumbing, pest control, etc.

It is designed to:
- Allow users to select a **Goal** (Winback, Expand, Advocate)
- Choose a **Tactic** tied to that goal
- Upload a customer dataset or use preloaded CSVs
- Receive a campaign-ready **Output Card** for a selected segment

This version uses minimal customer data, relies on GPT prompt stacking instead of ML, and assumes no formal CS tooling or CRM in the business.

## Usage Status

- UI built in Lovable
- Data must match metadata expectations (defined in `/data/schema_definitions/`)
- Generates prompt-driven segments and outreach kits per tactic
