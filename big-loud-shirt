# Big Loud Shirt App (Retail / DTC Demo)

This folder contains the front end for **Big Loud Shirt** — a flashy, simplified version of ODNB designed for DTC and multi-location retail businesses. It’s built for sales demo environments where the user has no data science or BI training.

Inspired by:
- Real-world retail use cases from segmentation tools like Elastic/OpenInsights
- The desire to wrap ML insights in an approachable, seller-focused UI

## Status

- Uses placeholder data from `/data/sample_customers/`
