# GTM Strategy Playbooks

This folder houses the strategic playbooks that power each segment’s GTM output.

Each playbook maps to a:
- **Goal** → Winback, Expand, Advocate
- **Tactic** → Specific campaign type
- **Industry (optional)** → Tailored output, tone, or offers

These are the source of truth for:
- How to interpret each segment
- What offers/channels work best
- How to generate campaign messaging
- What buyer personas respond to

## Playbook File Format

Use one Markdown or YAML file per tactic:
- `winback_reactivation_playbook.md`
- `expand_upsell_playbook.md`
- `advocate_referral_playbook.md`

Each file should include:

1. 🎯 **Tactic Overview**
2. 🔍 **Ideal Segment Traits**
3. 🎁 **Offer Types That Convert**
4. 📢 **Recommended Channels**
5. 🧍‍♂️ **Persona & Messaging Guidance**
6. 🔁 **Timing / Follow-up Recommendations**
7. 📥 **Required Meta Fields**
8. 🧠 **Prompt Tips or Overrides**

---

## Future Structure

Eventually, these will map to:
- Output card generation
- Prompt routing
- Success taxonomy indexing
